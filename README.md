# Turtle-Reidentification
Implementing a DNN (MegaDescriptor) and tools from 'WildlifeDatasets: An open-source toolkit for animal re-identification' for turtle biometric reidentification.

Used the Reunion turtles database which can be downloaded from here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wildlifedatasets/seaturtleidheads. 
Toolset used for implementation can be found from this repository - https://github.com/WildlifeDatasets/wildlife-datasets

I have attached my edited versions of the required API, as found bugs in the provided ones.
